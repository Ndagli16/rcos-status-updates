## Last Week's Accomplishments
Unfortunatly I was unable to complete much work last week becuase I had a programming languages test and some other work that neede
to be completed that week.

## This Week's Plan
This week the plan is to take a look at the issue alex assigned me on github and begin working on that. I will also begin creating the flask generator for the automated backend code genteration as well.

## Anything Blocking?
Getting familiar with javascript and javascript templeting and the flask framwork. This is the first time I have done any web dev so figureing out the given technologies like setting up docker to a local web server for testing have been proving to be an issue using WSL. Also I am still getting familair with the project setup as well.
