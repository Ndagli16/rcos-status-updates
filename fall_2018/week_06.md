## Last Week's Accomplishments
Made some progress on implementing on_put and on_delete routes. Also began moving over the import code into the controller

## This Week's Plan
Finish up the routes portion of the generator and hopefully get a shippable product by our presentation on friday.

## Anything Blocking?
Getting familiar with the javascript and the falcon framwork. Also getting familair with the project setup as well.
