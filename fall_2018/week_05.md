## Last Week's Accomplishments
Made meaningful progress on the python generator. Decided to switch from using flask, and moved over to creating a falcon generator.Updated the routes and resources generators. Added code for the belongs too relation and moved importing to the controller
## This Week's Plan
Plan on working on the on_put and on_delete routes for the generator and clean up some of the code moving more imports over to the controller.

## Anything Blocking?
Getting familiar with the javascript and the falcon framwork. Also getting familair with the project setup as well.
