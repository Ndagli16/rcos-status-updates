## Last Week's Accomplishments
Made meaningful progress on the python generator. Decided to switch from using flask, and moved over to creating a falcon generator as flask was proving to be a pain to work with. Updated the routes and resources generators. Added code for the belongs too relation and moved importing to the controller

## This Week's Plan
Plan on working on the on_put and on_delete routes for the generator and clean up some of the code moving more imports over to the controller.

## Anything Blocking?
Getting familiar with javascript templeting and learning the falcon framework.
