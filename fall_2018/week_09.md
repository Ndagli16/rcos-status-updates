## Last Week's Accomplishments
Was able to make some meaningful progess on the routes protion of the generator. Also went back and looked at the on_put and on_delete routes as well.

## This Week's Plan
Nearing the end of the semester I have a lot of work to complete for a bunch of other classes so I cant continue working on the project this week. I plan on continue contributing to the proejct after the semester ends though.

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing blocking this week.
