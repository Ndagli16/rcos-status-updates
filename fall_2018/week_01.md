## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I met up with Alex in order to get a better grasp on the project, its structure and what I should be expecting
to do in general for codotype.

## This Week's Plan
The plan for this week is to start contributing to the project, and address the github issue that was given to me
by alex.

## Anything Blocking?
Limited experience with using JS, and still trying to figure out the the full scope of the generators.
