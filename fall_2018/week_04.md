## Last Week's Accomplishments
Began to make some meaningful progress on building out the flask backend generator

## This Week's Plan
This week I plan on finishing up the flask backend generator and then begin working on cranking out backend generators for django and other languages.

## Anything Blocking?
Getting familiar with the javascript and the flask + django framwork. Also still getting familair with the project setup as well.
