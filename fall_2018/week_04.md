## Last Week's Accomplishments
Began to make some meaningful progress on building out the flask backend generator. Took some time to figure out how to use postman to make API testing easier and getting my VM environement set up for project devolpment. Also learned how to use docker at a basic level for the context of this project. 

## This Week's Plan
This week I plan on trying to finish up the flask backend generator and then begin working on cranking out backend generators for django and other languages.

## Anything Blocking?
Getting familiar with the javascript and the flask + django framwork. Also still getting familair with the project setup as well but at this point have most of it completly figured out.
