## Last Week's Accomplishments
I was not able too make much progress this week due to having a programming languages test and I was not really prepared at all so I spent most of the week studying this test 

## This Week's Plan
Finish up the routes portion of the generator and hopefully get a shippable product by our presentation on friday. Also finish up implementing the on_put and on_delete routes. 

## Anything Blocking?
Not much is blocking me this update, not having too many issues as is.
